# LightGBM
a faster boosting-based model made by microsoft
I. Basic introduction

LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses a learning algorithm based decision tree.

It can be said to be distributed and efficient, it has the following advantages:

- faster training efficiency

- Low memory usage

- better accuracy

- Support for parallel learning

- Can handle large-scale data

Compared with commonly used machine learning algorithms: Speed up
